# MCP Server: Modular Code Analysis Platform Wiki

Welcome to the wiki for the **Modular Code Analysis Platform (MCP) Server**.

This project is a Proof-of-Concept (POC) designed to demonstrate advanced software engineering skills, particularly in software architecture, design patterns, SOLID principles, and cloud knowledge. It aims to provide a flexible and extensible backend for code analysis, supporting multiple programming languages and AI providers.

## Table of Contents

- [Project Architecture](architecture.md)
- [Plugin System Deep Dive](plugin-system.md)
- [Getting Started (Local Setup)](getting-started.md)
- [Testing Strategy](testing.md)
- [CI/CD with GitHub Actions](ci-cd.md)
- [Extending the System](extensibility.md)

## Core Goals

- **Multi-client support**: Accommodate different tech stacks (Python, Ruby, Java, Go, Elixir, JavaScript).
- **AI provider flexibility**: Support various AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, local models, Ollama).
- **Zero-config deployment**: Engineers can clone the repo and it works with their specific stack.
- **Fully dockerized**: Complete containerization with a frontend interface.
- **Plugin-based architecture**: Stack-specific analyzers as plugins.

## Core Functionalities

- Continuous commit analysis with quality assessment.
- Test coverage verification and reporting.
- Refactoring suggestions based on SOLID principles and design patterns.
- AI-powered code improvement recommendations.
- Integration with development tools (GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude Code, Cursor).

This wiki provides detailed documentation on the design, implementation, and usage of the MCP Server.
